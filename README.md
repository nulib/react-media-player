# React Media Player

A React component which renders a YouTube style player and thumbnails UI. We're aiming for:

- Switching between video or audio files
- Using native HTML `<video />` element
- Rendering navigable sections based (initially) on `WebVTT` structure
- Driven by IIIF structure

## Development

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build

```
npm run build
```
